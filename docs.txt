(D)&(F) -> Left-Right Movement.
(J)&(K) -> Up-Down Movement.

(R) -> Move backwards in the current bufferline until a word-break character is detected.
(U) -> Move forwards in the current bufferline until a word-break character is detected. (and then move past it)

This is slightly different to VIM-like W-B movement, since going back goes to the *end* of a word,
and going forward goes to the *start* of a word.

(I) -> Go into Text Insert mode.
(A) -> Move buffer cursor character index to the end, and go into Text Insert Mode.
(Esc) -> Go into Command mode.

(Ctrl + S) -> Save active buffer.
