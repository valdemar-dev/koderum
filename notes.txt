undo-redo history

/ols.json

todo:
    - n/b term search case sensitive within buffer
    - selections with v mode
    - yank selection with y (into buffer, into clipboard with Ctrl-y)
    - shortcut for deleting entire line
    - paste buffer with p (clipboard with Ctrl-p)
    - close buffer with Ctrl-q
    - string encounters in word split
    literally just move everything to word split
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - add always loaded characters configurable in .conf
    - add lerp anim to text hl
    - should retain clipboard history
    - start of line keybind
    - v to highlight search term
    - add ctrl + r reload

requirements:
    must be practically infinite
    
    must be able to retain knowledge of
    undo-redo, even after closing a buffer, or even the application.
    should be minimal in its storage usage.
    
ideas:
    index undo history via file names.
    
    
thoughts:
    somehow, the user needs to be able to restore precisely what they have done.
    this means, storing change.
    how would one store change?
