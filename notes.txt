undo-redo history

                    asdf
thoughts part 2:
    - the editor MUST learn how to speak in tree-sitter nodes.
    - more accurately, it MUST learn how to query, and parse, only those nodes that we want.
      walking thorugh node lists is EXHAUSTING.
      generating tokens for 8000 loc should take 2ms tops
    
    - generating tokens was ridiculously cheap.
      we gen the entire screen in less than 1ms.
      something else is bugging us down.
      im gonna try to make lines into [dynamic]u8 instead of []rune

todo:
    - n/b term search case sensitive within buffer
    - selections with v mode
    - close buffer with Ctrl-q
    literally just move everything to word split
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - add always loaded characters configurable in .conf 
    - add lerp anim to text hl
    - should retain clipboard history (not yank)
    - add ctrl + r reload
    - store where you were pre search, go back with b
    - dedent indent selection
    - mkdir to fb
    - reopening filebrowser should uncache all files
    - put correct advance in glyph alredy
    
    - store arbitrary line number and ctrl+b to return
    - literally add INDENTING YOU STUPID IDIOT
bugs:    
    - hl only works for 1 item per line
    
requirements:
    must be practically infinite
    
    must be able to retain knowledge of
    undo-redo, even after closing a buffer, or even the application.
    should be minimal in its storage usage.
    
ideas:
    index undo history via file names.
    
    
thoughts:
    somehow, the user needs to be able to restore precisely what they have done.
    this means, storing change.
    how would one store change?
