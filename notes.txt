undo-redo history


today:
    - consolidate buffer insert changes into one change on ESC
    - think of a way to not have any code per-language. but just syntax files.
      user can then install. should not be compilation dependent

todo:
    - n/b term search case sensitive within buffer
    - selections with v mode
    - close buffer with Ctrl-q
    literally just move everything to word split
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - add ctrl + r reload
    - reopening filebrowser should uncache all files
    
    - 
bugs:    
    - hl only works for 1 item per line
