reminders:
    - THREAD SAFETY!!
    - SAFE THREAD
    - THREAD MUST BE SAFE FOR OPERATION MMM THREAD

todo:
    - add variable font weights
    - renaming a file should rename and send a didclose/didopen
    - holy shit get rid of active_language server it is a spawn of satan
      each buffer should have a field that is a pointer to a LanguageServer
        (for this remember when closing to like clear via a loop of the buffers)
    
think:
    - control + escape is a bad keybind for the terminal input mode switching.
    - GUI mode with every file opened, listed
    
bugs:
    - nil pointer dereference in set_tokens() when reloading a file
    // maybe fixed? - bad free in reset_completion_hits(), from set_buffer_cursor_pos-
    // maybe fixed? - nil pointer dereference in hit_ptr.detail in resolve completion hit
    - malformed LSP json panic sometimes?
    - undo is fucked (?) bad positioning
    - does not track all allocations? / unnoticed memory leak
    - draw_text_buffer mutex when hitting F5 to reload lsp
    - ctrl + e bad free?
    
    
    
    - annoying shit with moving around.
      cut a thing, and suddenly you're WAY in the wrong direction. something to do with centering the camera after a large action, cut, paste, x.
