today:
    - add priority checking :D

high priority todo:

todo:
    - close buffer with Ctrl-q
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - add ctrl + r reload
    - reopening filebrowser should uncache all files
    - consolidate buffer insert changes into one change on ESC
    - we can probably just do JSON for this
        - add "do overwrite token if found" to lsp options
    
    - maybe have two trees for parsing, threaded and single-threaded
    - probably separate LSP and TS tokens? this will prevent the "flash", that is seen.    
    - implement yank-buffer history usage and view
    - add go to line

bugs:    
    - undo redo for reverse removals is kind of weird.
    - paste replace does not work
    - paste replace does not use clipboard
    - hl only works for 1 item per line
    - swapping between files does not change the active language server
    - any movement action should trigger refresh of everything.
      including constrain scroll, constrain cursor, get suggestions, and get error.
