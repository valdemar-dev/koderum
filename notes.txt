todo:
    - add variable font weights
think:
    - control + escape is a bad keybind for the terminal input mode switching.
    
bugs:
    - bad free in edit_alert(?)
    - nil pointer dereference in set_tokens() when reloading a file
    // maybe fixed? - bad free in reset_completion_hits(), from set_buffer_cursor_pos-
    // maybe fixed? - nil pointer dereference in hit_ptr.detail in resolve completion hit
    - malformed LSP json panic sometimes?
    - undo is fucked (?) bad positioning
    - does not track all allocations? / unnoticed memory leak
