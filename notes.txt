undo-redo history

todo:
    - n/b term search case sensitive within buffer
    - selections with v mode
    - close buffer with Ctrl-q
    literally just move everything to word split
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - add always loaded characters configurable in .conf 
    - add lerp anim to text hl
    - should retain clipboard history (not yank)
    - add ctrl + r reload
    - store where you were pre search, go back with b
    - dedent indent selection
    - mkdir to fb
    - reopening filebrowser should uncache all files
    - put correct advance in glyph alredy
    
    - store arbitrary line number and ctrl+b to return
    - literally add INDENTING YOU STUPID IDIOT
bugs:    
    - hl only works for 1 item per line
    
requirements:
    must be practically infinite
    
    must be able to retain knowledge of
    undo-redo, even after closing a buffer, or even the application.
    should be minimal in its storage usage.
    
ideas:
    index undo history via file names.
    
    
thoughts:
    somehow, the user needs to be able to restore precisely what they have done.
    this means, storing change.
    how would one store change?
