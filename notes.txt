today:
    - add priority checking :D

high priority todo:

todo:
    - consolidate buffer insert changes into one change on ESC
    - we can probably just do JSON for this
        - add "do overwrite token if found" to lsp options    
    - add variable font weights
    - add fps and char-line to ui
    - add is saved state to ui
    
bugs:
    - shift c on last line doesn't work
    - ctrl + b is janky, goes to buffers that don't exist
