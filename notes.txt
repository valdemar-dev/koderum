add t for persistant terminal instance

add savestate checking
dont panic if failing to save

ADD SOMEWHERE IN DOCS: make sure to hit enter to set your CWD

bug:
    - lstat is annoying, need statx unix syscall instead of stat, but odin
      uses stat. might write my own, idk.

add multiline and singleline comments
add godef, find instanes, and replace all
add file creation to file browser, file deleteion and renaming also

very annoying, gnome requires supression of char event.
win and other unix dont.
find a way to determine either the DE, or to handle the ignore on non gnome DE's
