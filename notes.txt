today:
    - add priority checking :D

high priority todo:

todo:
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - consolidate buffer insert changes into one change on ESC
    - we can probably just do JSON for this
        - add "do overwrite token if found" to lsp options    
    - maybe have two trees for parsing, threaded and single-threaded
    - probably separate LSP and TS tokens? this will prevent the "flash", that is seen.    
    - implement yank-buffer history usage and view
    - add variable font weights

bugs:    
    - hl only works for 1 item per line
    - any movement action should trigger refresh of everything.
      including constrain scroll, constrain cursor, get suggestions, and get error.
