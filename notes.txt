undo-redo history


todo:
    - n/b term search case sensitive within buffer
    - selections with v mode
    - close buffer with Ctrl-q
    literally just move everything to word split
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - add ctrl + r reload
    - reopening filebrowser should uncache all files
    
    - 
bugs:    
    - hl only works for 1 item per line
    
requirements:
    must be practically infinite
    
    must be able to retain knowledge of
    undo-redo, even after closing a buffer, or even the application.
    should be minimal in its storage usage.
    
ideas:
    index undo history via file names.
    
    
thoughts:
    somehow, the user needs to be able to restore precisely what they have done.
    this means, storing change.
    how would one store change?
