today:

high priority todo:

todo:
    - close buffer with Ctrl-q
    - Ctrl +DFJK movement for in-buffer movement
    - add ctrl + r reload
    - reopening filebrowser should uncache all files
    - consolidate buffer insert changes into one change on ESC
    - we can probably just do JSON for this
    - maybe have two trees for parsing, threaded and single-threaded
    
    - implement ui-scaling. values should be math.rounded,
      however, fractional values should be allowed.
    - ui-rework, need some fancy shmancier boxes and stuff.

bugs:    
    - hl only works for 1 item per line
