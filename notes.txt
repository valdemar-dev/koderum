add t for persistant terminal instance

add savestate checking
dont panic if failing to save

ADD SOMEWHERE IN DOCS: make sure to hit enter to set your CWD

bug:
    - lstat is annoying, need statx unix syscall instead of stat, but odin
      uses stat. might write my own, idk.

add multiline and singleline comments
add godef, find instanes, and replace all
add file creation to file browser, file deleteion and renaming also

c-jk for file offset in file browser
c-d for create file (if ends in /, make dir instead)
c-f for rename (if ends in /, make into dir)

add priority to HL:
for example, comments //, should take priority
over strings. this is basic programming.
each language rule set will, and can determine
its own priorities. default priority 0.
string clauses will have 1.

to strings, change them from runes to strings.
define a start&end string separately.
this allows for easy single and multi-line comments.
eg. // \n, /* */
which is not only more versatile, but easier to check.
