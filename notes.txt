today:

high priority todo:
todo:
    - add variable font weights
    - add is saved state to ui
    - add grep -Rn with "go to file and line" support
    - delete old syntax_language.odin files
    
bugs:
    - sometimes hangs in termianl when switching to terminal (2?). appears at first glance to happen randomly
    - deleting search term can go -1 causing a segfault
    
    - mem leak in grep, fix later
